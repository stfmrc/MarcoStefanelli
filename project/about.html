        <p>I am Marco Stefanelli, an Italian researcher with a multidisciplinary 
           background in Earth System Physics, Climate Science, Climate and Weather Modelling, 
           Data Assimilation, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
           <br><br>

           I hold a PhD in Future Earth, Climate Change, and Societal Challenges 
           from the University of Bologna in collaboration with CMCC 
           (Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change). 
           My research focused on data assimilation 
           for advanced cross-scale unstructured grid ocean modelling.
           <br><br>

           Currently, I am a <a href="https://smash.ung.si/">SMASH</a> postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty 
           of Mathematics and Physics (FMF) at the University of Ljubljana (Slovenia). My research involves Data assimilation,
           Artificial Intelligence and Weather Forecast. The main goal is to improve the forecast of severe precipitation
           events using weather radar data (read the <a href="ongoing_projects.html"> abstract</a>). 
           <br><br>

           Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of impactful projects, 
           including my research at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) 
           on urbanization effects on the West African monsoon. I am also passionate about outreach and 
           citizen science, having led projects aimed at raising awareness of climate change and air 
           quality issues. Additionally, I have experience teaching and mentoring, having worked as a 
           secondary school teacher in computer and energy sciences. 
           <br><br>

           I am currently privileged to collaborate with Prof. Simone Napolitano, 
           a professor at the art high school in Mantova, in the field of scientific dissemination. 
           Our work focuses on how to effectively bring complex scientific concepts
           (e.g. Chaos Theory) into high school classrooms. In this ongoing collaboration, 
           I contribute my expertise in developing methods to support teachers in introducing 
           challenging topics to students, ensuring these subjects remain accessible and engaging.
           Another important goal of our partnership is to increase awareness of climate change 
           among younger generations, helping them understand its scientific underpinnings and 
           motivating them to become active participants in environmental conservation. 
           <br><br>

           Fluent in both Italian and English, I am skilled in a variety of programming languages (Python, Fortran),
           Linux/Unix environments, and advanced data science tools like Jupyter and GitHub. I also have extensive 
           experience in managing large datasets in multiple formats, including NetCDF, GRIB, and HDF5, enabling me 
           to handle complex data-driven tasks efficiently and effectively. Additionally, I am an advanced user of 
           HPC environments such as SLURM, PBS, and LSF.
           <br><br>

           My academic journey has been marked by a deep commitment to environmental issues and scientific collaboration, 
           and I am always looking for new ways to leverage my expertise to drive innovation and awareness in climate science.
