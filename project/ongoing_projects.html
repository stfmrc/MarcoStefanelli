    <h1>A neural network-based observation operator for weather radar data assimilation</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      In three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVar) for numerical weather prediction (NWP),
      the observation operator H plays a central role by mapping model state variables to an
      observation equivalent. For weather radar, however, specifying H is particularly challenging:
      reflectivity is a nonlinear, microphysics-dependent diagnostic quantity that only indirectly relates to the
      model's prognostic variables, making traditional parameterised radar operators complex, regime-dependent,
      and difficult to tune.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this study, we propose a neural-network (NN)-based observation operator for radar reflectivity and apply it
      within a 3DVar data assimilation (DA) framework. Using five years (2019–2023) of radar reflectivity data from
      the Lisca radar and 4.4km-resolution short-range forecasts from the ALADIN model over Slovenia, we train a
      convolutional encoder–decoder neural network to map model temperature, humidity, horizontal wind components,
      and surface pressure fields to radar reflectivity. Across independent test cases spanning clear-sky, stratiform,
      and convective regimes, the NN-based operator accurately reproduces the spatial structure and intensity of
      observed reflectivity, relying primarily on the model state in the vicinity of the observation point.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the extreme precipitation case that caused widespread floods in Slovenia on August 4, 2023, assimilating the
      full radar disc reduces the domain-averaged reflectivity root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 5.99dBZ to
      3.47dBZ and improves the alignment between the analysed and observed convective bands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Embedded within 3DVar, the Jacobian of the NN observation operator allows radar reflectivity observations to
      inform model state variables, producing corresponding analysis increments. The proposed NN radar observation
      operator offers a flexible alternative to traditional parameterised radar operators for improving
      convective-storm forecasts.
