        <h1>A neural network-based observation operator for weather radar data assimilation</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Forecasting convective storms is a major challenge in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). 
            Data Assimilation (DA) improves the initial condition and subsequent forecasts by combining 
            observations and previous model forecasts (background). Weather radar provides a dense source of observations in storm monitoring. 
            Therefore, assimilating radar data should significantly improve storm forecasting skills. 
            However, the short-range precipitation forecast performed by extrapolating rainfall patterns (nowcasting) 
            from radar data is often better than numerical model-based forecasting with DA (Fabry and Meunier, 2020). 
            This is related to the fact that the radar data only provides information on the precipitation pattern and intensity 
            in the area affected by the storm. Furthermore, it does not directly provide information on the environmental conditions 
            of the storm, such as temperature, wind, and humidity, neither within the precipitation region nor in the areas far from the storm. 
            A potential solution involves using machine learning (ML) to construct the DA observation operator to generate a model-equivalent of the radar data. 
            In this approach, NWP model fields (temperature, wind components, relative humidity) would serve as input, and radar observations 
            would be the output of an encoder-decoder neural network. The constructed observation operator describes a non-linear relationship 
            between the NWP model storm-related variables and radar observations, while its Jacobian allows radar information to infer other variables 
            in the data assimilation, potentially enhancing storm forecasting skills. </p>
